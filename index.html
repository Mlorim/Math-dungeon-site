        When I was a child, I dreamed of becoming an adventurer. Unfortunately, I hadn’t talent for magic and was physically weak. Trainings haven’t show any result, and I almost gave up, but in one moment everything changed. Taking things apart in my grandfather's basement, I found it... A Math Sword! I don’t know who forged it, but he was really a master of his craft. This incredible weapon could destroy almost any enemy in my path with just one hit, ignoring their defense or parry. However, there was one caveat. I can make an ideal attack only by solving a mathematical example that pops up in my mind. Naturally, enemies will not just stand by and wait while I count. Thanks to trainings, I was able to speed up my mind and develop a good reaction, so now I have about 15 seconds to solve the example.
        To be honest, I'm even glad that the sword has this condition. There shouldn't be an easy way to make a dream come true. Everything depends only on me! I can't wait to enter my first dungeon!

            After you press "Enter the dungeon" button, you will have 15 seconds fo each entity. To write your answer use buttons on the screen or your keyboard.
            If you think you solved the example, hit the "Answer" button. Use "clear" button to reset your answer. If you successfully 
            solve the example, you will defeat the skeleton with the Math Sword. If you make a mistake or be to late, 
            you will lose. But don't get upset about it because you can always try again. Good luck!
